Phase 1 - 

General concepts of cards, players and hands:

    Cards (Card class and 52 instances thereof?) can be shuffled and dealt to 4 Player objects
    Concept of a "hand" is created for a Player, with some way to print that in an appropriate fashion to the terminal

Requirements: Create a class representing the game state,
a class representing a deck of cards, and a player class containing a hand of cards.

Will be importing the Random module to allow shuffling and dealing.

Class structure:
Hearts, the game state class, which will make use of the functions from the other sections.

Deck of Cards, containing lists of Suits and Values, which has the functions:
Shuffle, which creates a randomised list of cards
Deal, which deals a hand of cards to a player by popping cards from the deck.

Player will have an identifying feature, and have a hand which will be an empty list,
which we can populate from the cards drawn.
